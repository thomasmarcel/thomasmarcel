# 👋 Howdy! Welcome to the Techno Odyssey of a Code Maverick! 🚀

Howdy! I'm Thomas Alcala, a.k.a Animo, the Tech Sorcerer behind the digital
enchantments at [WaltR](https://waltr.fr) as the IT & Digital Director and the
Chief Alchemist (CTO) at [EEVET](https://eevet.com). With over 15 years in the
tech trenches, I sling code like a true full-stack ninja and worship at the
altar of Rust programming.

## 💼 The Chronicles of a Tech Overlord

🚀 **IT & Digital Director at WaltR**  
Masterminding digital escapades, steering IT strategies, and leading a fellowship of tech wizards to conjure up groundbreaking solutions.

🌐 **CTO at EEVET**

💻 **Full-Stack Sorcery**  
I've dabbled in countless quests, mastering the art of spellbinding technologies and weaving them into magnificent digital tapestries.

## 💡 The Rust Crusader

A fervent believer in the power of Rust, the magical elixir among programming languages! Its enchanting mix of safety, speed, and parallelism makes it the Excalibur of software crafting.

## 🌟 What Sorcery Awaits
